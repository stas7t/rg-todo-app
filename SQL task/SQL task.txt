1. get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered

SELECT DISTINCT tasks.status 
FROM tasks 
ORDER BY tasks.status ASC;

2. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending
SELECT COUNT(*) AS tasks_count 
FROM projects, tasks 
WHERE tasks.project_id = projects.id 
GROUP BY projects.id 
ORDER BY tasks_count DESC;

3. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names

SELECT projects.name, COUNT(*) AS tasks_count 
FROM projects, tasks 
WHERE tasks.project_id = projects.id 
GROUP BY projects.id 
ORDER BY projects.name ASC;

4. get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter

SELECT * 
FROM projects, tasks 
WHERE tasks.project_id = projects.id AND projects.name LIKE 'N%';

5. get the list of all projects containing the ‘a’ letter in the middle of the name, 
and show the tasks count near each project

SELECT projects.id, projects.name, COUNT(*) AS tasks_count 
FROM projects, tasks 
WHERE tasks.project_id = projects.id AND projects.name LIKE '%a%'
GROUP BY projects.id 
ORDER BY projects.name ASC;

6. get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically

SELECT name, COUNT(name) 
FROM tasks 
GROUP BY name HAVING ( COUNT(name) > 1 ) 
ORDER BY name ASC;

7. get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, 
from the project ‘Garage’. Order by matches count

SELECT tasks.name, tasks.status, COUNT(*) AS matches
FROM projects, tasks 
WHERE tasks.project_id = projects.id AND projects.name LIKE 'Garage' 
GROUP BY tasks.name, tasks.status
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY matches ASC;

8. get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’. 
Order by project_id 

SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.status) 
FROM projects, tasks 
WHERE tasks.project_id = projects.id AND tasks.status LIKE 'completed'
GROUP BY tasks.status, projects.name, tasks.project_id
HAVING COUNT(tasks.status) > 10
ORDER BY tasks.project_id ASC;
